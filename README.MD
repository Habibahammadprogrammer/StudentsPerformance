# Student Performance Analysis & Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes student performance data from the UCI Student Performance Dataset (Math & Portuguese subjects).  
It aims to provide **early, data-driven signals** for students at risk of underperforming.  

Key components:
- Data cleaning 
- Data transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering)
- Supervised learning (classification: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Model evaluation and Comparison
- Storytelling and Recommendations
